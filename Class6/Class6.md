# Simplified Version

``` r
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
```

We are going to start by calculating the average score of the homeworks

``` r
mean(student1)
```

    [1] 98.75

To get the minimum score we can use `which.min.`

``` r
student1
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  90

``` r
which.min(student1)
```

    [1] 8

I can do the average of the first 7 homework scores:

``` r
mean(student1[1:7])
```

    [1] 100

Another way to select the first 7 homeworks:

``` r
student1[1:7]
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100

``` r
student1[-8]
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100

Another way to drop the lowest score:

``` r
student1_drop_lowest = student1[ -which.min(student1) ]
student1_drop_lowest
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100

I can get the mean of the homework scores after dropping the lowest
score by doing:

``` r
mean( student1_drop_lowest )
```

    [1] 100

We have our first working snippet of code!

Let’s try to generalize it to student 2:

``` r
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student2_drop_lowest = student2[ -which.min(student2) ]
student2_drop_lowest
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97

There is a way to calculate the mean dropping missing values(or NA)

``` r
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
mean(student2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    [1] 91

This looks good for student2. However, for student3

``` r
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
mean(student3, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    [1] 90

We want to know the position of the NAs. So, for student2 we can use the
following.

``` r
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
which(is.na(student2))
```

    [1] 2

For student 3:

``` r
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
which(is.na(student3))
```

    [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

For considering missing values, we can mask the NA with zeros.

``` r
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student2[2]
```

    [1] NA

``` r
student2[ which(is.na(student2))] <- 0
student2
```

    [1] 100   0  90  90  90  90  97  80

If I use the same for student 3:

``` r
student3[ is.na(student3)] <- 0
student3
```

    [1] 90  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

``` r
mean(student3)
```

    [1] 11.25

This is going to be our final working snippet of code for all student
(with and without NA value)

``` r
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
student3[ is.na(student3) ] <- 0
student3_drop_lowest <- student3[ -which.min(student3)]
mean(student3_drop_lowest)
```

    [1] 12.85714

Let’s build a function now:

``` r
x <- c(100, 75, 50, NA)

x [ is.na(x)] <- 0
x_drop_lowest <- x[ -which.min(x)]
mean(x_drop_lowest)
```

    [1] 75

# Function grade()

We can write it as a function:

``` r
#' Calculate the average score for a vector of 
#' homework scores, dropping the lowest score, 
#' and considering NA values as zeros
#' Title
#'
#' @param x 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' 
#' student <- c('100', '50', NA)
#' grade(student)
#' 
grade <- function(x){
    # Mask NA values with zero
    x [ is.na(x)] <- 0
    # Droping the lowest score
    x_drop_lowest <- x[ -which.min(x)]
    mean(x_drop_lowest)
}
```

Let’s apply the function

``` r
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
grade(student1)
```

    [1] 100

``` r
grade(student2)
```

    [1] 91

``` r
grade(student3)
```

    [1] 12.85714

Let’s apply our function to a gradebook from this URL:

“https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput

``` r
URL <- "https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput"
gradebook <- read.csv(URL, row.names = 1)
head(gradebook)
```

              hw1 hw2 hw3 hw4 hw5
    student-1 100  73 100  88  79
    student-2  85  64  78  89  78
    student-3  83  69  77 100  77
    student-4  88  NA  73 100  76
    student-5  88 100  75  86  79
    student-6  89  78 100  89  77

Let’s apply my function `grade` to the gradebook using `apply` and
running it by **rows** using `MARGIN=1`

``` r
apply(gradebook, 1, grade)
```

     student-1  student-2  student-3  student-4  student-5  student-6  student-7 
         91.75      82.50      84.25      84.25      88.25      89.00      94.00 
     student-8  student-9 student-10 student-11 student-12 student-13 student-14 
         93.75      87.75      79.00      86.00      91.75      92.25      87.75 
    student-15 student-16 student-17 student-18 student-19 student-20 
         78.75      89.50      88.00      94.50      82.75      82.75 

#### Q2. Using your grade() function and the supplied gradebook, Who is the top scoring student overall in the gradebook?

``` r
max(apply(gradebook, 1, grade))
```

    [1] 94.5

The maximum score is 94.5

``` r
which.max(apply(gradebook, 1, grade))
```

    student-18 
            18 

The student-18 getting the maximum overall score.

#### Q3. From your analysis of the gradebook, which homework was toughest on students (i.e. obtained the lowest scores overall

``` r
apply(gradebook, 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

         hw1      hw2      hw3      hw4      hw5 
    89.00000 80.88889 80.80000 89.63158 83.42105 

``` r
gradebook[ is.na(gradebook)] <- 0
```

Now we apply the `mean` function to the gradebook

``` r
apply(gradebook, 2, mean)
```

      hw1   hw2   hw3   hw4   hw5 
    89.00 72.80 80.80 85.15 79.25 

The toughest homework will be hw2 considering the mean, and considering
missing homework as 0.

Maybe having zeros for missing homework is two strict and is not a good
representation of the homework difficulty.

one thing we can do is remove the missing homework.

``` r
gradebook <- read.csv(URL, row.names = 1)
apply(gradebook, 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

         hw1      hw2      hw3      hw4      hw5 
    89.00000 80.88889 80.80000 89.63158 83.42105 

Instead of assigning zeros to missing values, if we directly don’t
consider missing values, the toughest homework will be hw2(according to
the mean)

If we use the median instead of the mean as a measure of overall score

``` r
apply(gradebook, 2, median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

     hw1  hw2  hw3  hw4  hw5 
    89.0 72.5 76.5 88.0 78.0 

If we use some plots:

``` r
boxplot(gradebook)
```

#### Q4. From your analysis of the gradebook, which homework was most predictive of overall score (i.e. highest correlation with average grade score)?

``` r
overall_grades = apply(gradebook, 1, grade)
overall_grades
```

     student-1  student-2  student-3  student-4  student-5  student-6  student-7 
         91.75      82.50      84.25      84.25      88.25      89.00      94.00 
     student-8  student-9 student-10 student-11 student-12 student-13 student-14 
         93.75      87.75      79.00      86.00      91.75      92.25      87.75 
    student-15 student-16 student-17 student-18 student-19 student-20 
         78.75      89.50      88.00      94.50      82.75      82.75 

``` r
cor(gradebook$hw1, overall_grades)
```

    [1] 0.4250204

``` r
gradebook[ is.na(gradebook) ] <- 0
apply(gradebook, 2, cor, y = overall_grades)
```

          hw1       hw2       hw3       hw4       hw5 
    0.4250204 0.1767780 0.3042561 0.3810884 0.6325982 

The maximum value is

``` r
which.max( apply(gradebook, 2, cor, y = overall_grades) )
```

    hw5 
      5 

hw5 was the most predictive score which correlated with the overall
score.
